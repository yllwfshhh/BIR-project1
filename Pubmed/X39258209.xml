The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to compare the activation of antigen-specific interferon (IFN)-&#x3b3;+ T cells in obese children and adolescents with healthy individuals before and after immunization with a single dose of live attenuated HAV vaccine.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Blood samples were obtained from the 2021 study by Dumrisilp et al. investigating the immunogenicity of the live attenuated hepatitis A vaccine in children and young adults. Prior to enrollment, all 212 subjects had never received any HAV vaccine and tested negative for anti-HAV antibodies. The participants were vaccinated with a freeze-dried, live attenuated HAV vaccine of the H2 strain. In this study, we analyzed the stored peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from a subgroup of 30 obese subjects and 30 normal-weight healthy controls of the same age and sex. PBMCs were collected before and 8-9 weeks after HAV vaccination for further analysis. These cells were stimulated with a recombinant antigen derived from HAV-VP3, and the immune response was evaluated using the IFN-&#x3b3; enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The between-group analysis indicated that the T-cell response of obese participants was comparable to that of normal-weight controls both before and after vaccination. The change in IFN-&#x3b3; production from before to after vaccination in the obese group was not significantly different from that of the control group. Additionally, in the obese group, no correlation was found between IFN-&#x3b3; production and clinical characteristics such as sex, body mass index, waist circumference, and acanthosis nigricans.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Testing for cellular immune response provides a comprehensive understanding of the overall immune response to vaccination. This study, the first to explore this significant aspect, suggests that obesity does not affect the short-term cellular immune response to live attenuated HAV vaccination.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#xa9; 2024 The Authors.
